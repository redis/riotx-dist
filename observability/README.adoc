= 📊 RIOT-X Observability Stack

Standalone Prometheus and Grafana stack for monitoring RIOT-X metrics.

== 🚀 Quick Start

To start the observability stack:

[source,console]
----
cd observability
docker compose up -d
----

This will start:

* **Prometheus** on http://localhost:9090
* **Grafana** on http://localhost:3000

== 📋 Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed
* RIOT-X instance running with `--metrics` flag
* RIOT-X metrics exposed on port 8080

== 🔧 Configuration

=== Prometheus

The Prometheus configuration is located at `prometheus/prometheus.yml`. By default, it scrapes metrics from `host.docker.internal:8080`.

To monitor a different RIOT-X instance, edit `prometheus/prometheus.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'riotx'
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    scrape_interval: 1s
    static_configs:
      - targets: [ 'your-host:your-port' ]
        labels:
          application: 'RIOT-X'
----

=== Grafana

Grafana is pre-configured with:

* **Data Source**: Prometheus (automatically configured)
* **Dashboard**: RIOT-X metrics dashboard (automatically loaded)

Default credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin` (you'll be prompted to change it on first login)

== 🎯 Accessing the Dashboard

1. Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with default credentials
3. Navigate to *Dashboards* → *RIOT-X*

== 🛑 Stopping the Stack

[source,console]
----
cd observability
docker compose down
----

== 🔄 Reusing in Other Projects

This observability stack can be reused in other projects or demos:

1. Copy the entire `observability/` directory to your project
2. Run: `cd observability && docker compose up -d`
